## 🎯 What This Project Does

Classifies boat images into 9 types:
- 🛟 Buoy
- 🚢 Cruise Ship
- ⛴️ Ferry Boat
- 🚛 Freight Boat
- 🛶 Gondola
- 🚤 Inflatable Boat
- 🛶 Kayak
- 📄 Paper Boat
- ⛵ Sailboat

**Expected Accuracy:** 75-85% (depends on dataset quality)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

```powershell
# Install Python 3.8+ and pip
python --version

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1: Train the Model (20-30 minutes)

```powershell
# 1. Open the notebook in VS Code
# File: boat-classification.ipynb

# 2. Run all cells from top to bottom (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Run All Cells")
# This will:
#   - Split your dataset into train/val/test (70/15/15 split)
#   - Train Custom CNN model
#   - Train MobileNetV2 model with transfer learning
#   - Compare both models
#   - Save the best model as boat_classifier_mobilenet.h5 or boat_classifier_cnn.h5

# 3. Move the best model to backend folder
Move-Item -Path "boat_classifier_*.h5" -Destination "backend\" -Force
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server

```powershell
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Install backend dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Flask server
python app.py

# You should see:
# ✓ Model loaded successfully
# Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 3: Test the Application

```powershell
# Open the frontend
start frontend\index.html

# Or manually open frontend/index.html in your browser
# Then:
# 1. Click "Choose Boat Image"
# 2. Select a test image from data/test/[any-class]/
# 3. View the prediction!
```

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Model:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- **Regularization:** Dropout, L2, BatchNormalization, Early Stopping

## 🔧 How to Improve Accuracy

### 1. Collect More Data (Most Important!)
Classes with <20 images will perform poorly. Aim for 100+ images per class.

```
Current: Some classes have only 3-10 images ❌
Target:  All classes should have 100+ images ✅
```

### 2. Recommended Sources for More Data
- **Kaggle:** Search for "boat datasets"
- **Google Images:** Use download extensions
- **Unsplash/Pexels:** Free stock photos

### 3. Code Is Already Optimized
The `boat-classification.ipynb` notebook already includes:
- ✅ Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip, shear)
- ✅ Two model architectures (Custom CNN + MobileNetV2)
- ✅ Dropout and Batch Normalization to prevent overfitting
- ✅ Early stopping (patience=5)
- ✅ Class weights for imbalanced data
- ✅ Transfer learning with MobileNetV2
- ✅ Comprehensive evaluation (confusion matrix, classification report)

## 📈 Expected Results

| Data Quality | Expected Accuracy |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Imbalanced data (current) | 70-80% |
| Balanced data (100+/class) | 85-90% |
| Production systems | 75-85% |

## � Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```powershell
# Make sure model exists
ls backend\boat_classifier_mobilenet.h5

# Reinstall dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Low accuracy
- Check if all classes have enough images (50+ recommended)
- Review training plots - if validation loss increases, model is overfitting
- Try collecting more diverse images

### Frontend shows error
- Ensure backend is running (http://localhost:5000)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Try a different browser

## 📝 Code Documentation

All code is heavily commented to help you understand:
- **Notebook:** Every cell explains what it does and why
- **Backend:** Every function has detailed docstrings
- **Comments:** Inline explanations for complex logic

## 📧 Next Steps

1. ✅ Train model using optimized notebook
2. ✅ Test with frontend
3. 📸 Collect more images for weak classes
4. 🔄 Retrain with balanced dataset
5. 🎯 Achieve 85%+ accuracy!
